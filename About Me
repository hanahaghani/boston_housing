A data science student with a strong focus on building interpretable machine learning models.
In this project, I applied Linear Regression on the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices while emphasizing data quality and model explainability.

Project Highlights:

Conducted structured EDA to understand feature behavior and correlations

Applied feature engineering and removed non-informative variables

Implemented scaling techniques (Standardization/Normalization) for stable model performance

Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²

Documented the workflow clearly to support reproducibility


This project strengthened my foundational skills in regression modeling, data preprocessing, and insight-driven analysis—skills I aim to expand as I transition further into machine learning and deep learning.
